        "body": "When watching a movie or an episode of a TV show, we experience a cohesive narrative that unfolds before us, often without giving much thought to the underlying structure that makes it all possible. However, movies and episodes are not atomic units, but rather composed of smaller elements such as frames, shots, scenes, sequences, and acts. Understanding these elements and how they relate to each other is crucial for tasks such as video summarization and highlights detection, content-based video retrieval, dubbing quality assessment, and video editing. At Netflix, such workflows are performed hundreds of times a day by many teams around the world, so investing in algorithmically-assisted tooling around content understanding can reap outsized rewards."

        "title": "Migrating Netflix to GraphQL Safely",
        "body": "In 2022, a major change was made to Netflixs iOS and Android applications. We migrated Netflixs mobile apps to GraphQL with zero downtime, which involved a total overhaul from the client to the API layer. Until recently, an internal API framework, Falcor, powered our mobile apps. They are now backed by Federated GraphQL, a distributed approach to APIs where domain teams can independently manage and own specific sections of the API. Doing this safely for 100s of millions of customers without disruption is exceptionally challenging, especially considering the many dimensions of change involved. This blog post will share broadly-applicable techniques (beyond GraphQL) we used to perform this migration. The three strategies we will discuss today are AB Testing, Replay Testing, and Sticky Canaries."
